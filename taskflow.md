# Task Flow

This page lays out an idealized breakdown of project work so that I can focus on one thing at a time stay close to "green bar" (Many Much More Smaller Steps) and see progress.

**Tasks**

I'm loosely using "deliverable" and "task" in the sense of "a deliverable may be decomposed into tasks" in the following. I expect to revisit the wording. Alistair Cockburn calls them all tasks, with the notion of "above, at, below sea level" for larger/more abstract and smaller/more particular.

**Types**

* Environment tasks. (chore) See [goals](./goals.md) for desired developer workflow.
* Application tasks. (feature, bug) See [goals](./goals.md) for core and non-core wiki features.
* Investigation tasks. (spike, feasibility). These will arise in the course of working on and planning or designing environment or application tasks. The deliverable is a _finding_ rather than a workflow change, deployment affordance, or wiki feature.


**Taskboard**

Do I want to use Github issues? Decide later. For now, track in [progress/tasks](./progress/tasks.md)

* Entering the taskboard.
    * Deliverable. Choose a demo-able bit of progress, or a meaningful chore.
    * Name the deliverable. What does it accomplish?
    * Task. Break off a small step, maybe a half-day. Small!
    * Add it to [tasks](./progress/tasks.md)
* Do the task in the appropriate way (docs, tests, review, refactor?)
* Check it in. Check it off. Reflect. Progress log.
* Next. Does this deliverable have more work? Is there a better current choice?
