# Taskboard

Initial set-up as task list. See [taskflow](../taskflow.md) for a
notion of how and why to break down tasks, suggesting details to
work out once the project is in the circle of life. See [goals](../goals.md) for needs in the area of developer environment, wiki domain, and feasibility investigation which could generate deliverables and tasks.

* [X] Set up git repo structure.
* [X] Create a tabular links file [./links](./links.md) for project information sources. Maybe this ends up in the wiki later.
* [X] Add Elixir links (hexdocs.pm, elixir-lang.org, phoenixframework.org) to the links file.
* [X] Publish to GitHub. Maybe to Sourcehut later on.
* [X] Add Phoenix how-to and docs links to the links file.
* [X] Read about how to start a Phoenix webapp project.
* [X] Install Phoenix and prerequisites.
* [X] Database or no database? What happens if we say no now? _Punted._ `mix phx.new --no-ecto wiki` At this point it's OK to rebuild the Phoenix app with or without DB.
* [X] Initialize a Phoenix hello-world project. `mix phx.new --no-ecto wiki`
* [X] Run: `cd wiki; mix phx.server` also watches for changes and rebuilds (== devserver task)
* [X] Change a file (the template for the home page) by changing SVG logo colors, reload and see the change.
* [?] Find out how to add Elixir (mix) build and test targets. Doc/link this.
* [ ] Routes?
