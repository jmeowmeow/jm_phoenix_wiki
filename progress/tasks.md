# Taskboard

Initial set-up as task list. See [taskflow](../taskflow.md) for a
notion of how and why to break down tasks, suggesting details to
work out once the project is in the circle of life. See [goals](../goals.md) for needs in the area of developer environment, wiki domain, and feasibility investigation which could generate deliverables and tasks.

* [X] Set up git repo structure.
* [X] Create a tabular links file [./links](./links.md) for project information sources. Maybe this ends up in the wiki later.
* [X] Add Elixir links (hexdocs.pm, elixir-lang.org, phoenixframework.org) to the links file.
* [X] Publish to GitHub. Maybe to Sourcehut later on.
* [X] Add Phoenix how-to and docs links to the links file.
* [ ] Read about how to start a Phoenix webapp project.
* [ ] Database or no database? What happens if we say no now?
* [ ] Install Phoenix and prerequisites.
* [ ] Initialize a Phoenix hello-world project. 
* [ ] Find out how to add Elixir (mix) build and test targets. Doc/link this.
* [ ] Add build, run, and test targets following a typical model or per Phoenix guides.
